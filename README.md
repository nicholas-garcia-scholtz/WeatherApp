# 🌦️ WeatherApp

A simple, responsive weather application built with React and JavaScript. It fetches live weather data from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) based on a user’s location input, then displays real-time conditions like temperature, heat index, and forecast icons.

The app loads data for Auckland by default and updates dynamically when a new city is entered. Weather data is rendered with clear visual cues, and the interface features centered layout, smooth hover effects, and clean styling for an intuitive experience.
